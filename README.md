# 10 kilobytes of Nagato Yuki

An excerpt from the "Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya" novel, adapted to work as a [visual novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) - adding graphics and a degree of interaction to your reading experience.

The excerpt was not modified, and can still be read just like a normal novel if you wish to do so.

Visual novel mode assets are only loaded once user presses the "Read as visual novel" button - but are still under 10 kilobytes.
